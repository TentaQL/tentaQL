  const instructions = `<h2>Greetings from the TentaQL team!</h2><p>TentaQL is a new open-source tool for rapidly prototyping a GraphQL sandbox environment with legacy SQL and NoSQL databases, currently supporting PostgreSQL, Mongo, and MySQL. No complicated logins are required, just a simple database URI -- TentaQL introspects schematic data and assembles a lightweight zip package for running a tailor-made GraphQL sandbox environment for the user's database. The zip comes complete with core CRUD query/mutation functionality and support for complex relationships, all while leveraging GraphiQL, an industry-leading visualization tool. For more experienced users, TentaQL also offers in-browser editing to further customize queries/mutations/subscriptions prior to download.</p><h2>Instructions:</h2><p>Paste your database address in the URL box, and click "Convert your DB". (Note: If running your Database locally, please use your IP address as 'host' and allow all remote connections)</p>
  <p>Your database is then converted to GraphQL language and will be displayed on the code editor for further customization and browsing before download.</p><p>Next, click to "Download" your zipped GraphQL server package.</p><p>Unzip the package, navigate into the directory, then run in your terminal:</p><p>npm install</p><p>npm run start</p><p>As soon as the server starts, a locahost on your Browser will automatically launch an instance of GraphiQL. Now you can start querying your Database with CRUD functionality, queries and mutationscustom querys</p>
